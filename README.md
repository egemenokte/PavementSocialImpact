# Pavement Social Impact

This repository contains the code used in the study titled [A quantitative methodology for measuring the social sustainability of pavement deterioration](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52655-7)

## Description
This study introduces a methodology to quantify the impact of road condition on vulnerable communities, specifically Environmental Justice (EJ) communities. It analyzes fuel consumption for road users during recurrent home-work trips as a function of pavement condition for EJ and non-EJ communities. 

The main components of the code include:
- `Network_ARCGIS`: Builds a network and calculates the shortest path.
- `RoadAnalysis`: Calculates the impacts due to road condition.
- `Plot_Functions`: Displays the final results, also presented in the study.
